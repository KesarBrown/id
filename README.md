# Why a seperate new identity?
* An experiment to build myself from scratch around the ideas that are worth spreading.
* Over the years an identity builds attachments to a bigger community. The human beneath may keep evolving in different ways. I see a need to shield the identity associated with ideas from  my inherited  original identity  that links to my family and blood relations. 
* This is an attempt to protect everyone and everything that may get affected if I had used my real identity and the opposite forces wanted create an intentional harm to the identity and thereby create harm to people associated with that identity. 
* The world on social media has become a bit complicated and opinions expressed can cause risk to current and future employer. So to protect the employer/employees and projects  from that risk as well. 
* The internet also has become complicated, the content is now not just being indexed by Search Engines but also by Large Language Models in some ways and used and manipulated in ways that are beyond control of individual. In olden times, only few famous people had to deal with bullying from paparazzi  but in modern days, this has taken tiny yet widespread form. A new identity can sometime help you create a soft shield for automated indexing to separate your content from your own life. 
* Why ‘Kesar Brown’?  Well, why not? Kesar means Saffron, a powerful spice and  Brown because I don’t want it to be black or white. 
* A human can vanish due to it's biological process. If the identity can be separated it can live and attach to anyone willing to responsibly and respectfully embody the identity within the family. A few close friends and family will always know the person beneath this identity.
* An Identity that allows me to express creative freedom. But also an identity that allows me to undo the effects/influence of social media algorithms. When you allow yourself to start from zero where the internet brain hasn't learnt about you, then you can pick and chose who to follow and what comes in your media feed. Ultimately, the basis of human body is that it becomes what it consumes from it's surrounding and our brain is no different.
